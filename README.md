# Learning Redis [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning Redis [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-redis-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781784396596), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
A database is the backbone of any application, and for developers working with varied and sizable data sets, selecting an appropriate data store is a critical development consideration. Redis, an in-memory, key-value data store offers simplified, rapid data access, valuable in a range of situations where instant access is necessary, for example with data caching.

Learning Redis is an example-based introduction which demonstrates how to work with the data store by creating a playable word game, written in Node.js. Fundamental topics of Redis are covered along the way.

You’ll see how simple it is to install the database on your own machine or use a database provider in the cloud. Together we will discover the basic native data types of Redis and how to use them as we write a real game using JavaScript in a Node.js environment.We’ll store and retrieve data using the Redis CLI and understand the basic NoSQL data keys and storage techniques.

Whether you’re writing a game or any other application, you need a place to store data. Learning Redis will demonstrate why you should implement Redis.

Throughout the course, we will put to use the important concepts of Redis such as keys, values, sets, and hashes, which will help us build a solid application that works on some of the most important app requirements such as information storage, validation, pub/sub, notifications, and sorting.

By the end of the course, you will understand how to make use of all of Redis’ features so you can design applications with rapid, efficiently managed data access.
